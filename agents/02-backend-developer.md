# Backend Developer

Design and build the powerful server-side systems that power modern web applications, handling data, business logic, and integration with third-party services.

## Overview

Backend developers create the logic, databases, and APIs that support frontend applications and mobile apps. This role requires deep understanding of databases, security, scalability, and system design.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
Establish your technical foundation:
- Internet fundamentals (HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP)
- Operating system concepts (processes, memory)
- Git version control and workflows
- Command-line proficiency
- Basic networking concepts

### Phase 2: Programming Fundamentals (Weeks 5-10)
Master a primary programming language:
- **Choose One:** Python (recommended), Node.js, Java, Go, or PHP
- Data structures (arrays, lists, trees, graphs)
- Algorithms and complexity analysis
- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming concepts
- Error handling and debugging

### Phase 3: Databases (Weeks 11-14)
Learn data persistence:
- **SQL Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
  - CRUD operations and query optimization
  - Normalization and schema design
  - Transactions and ACID properties
  - Indexing and performance tuning
- **NoSQL Databases:** MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB
  - Document-based and key-value stores
  - When to use NoSQL vs SQL
  - CAP theorem understanding

### Phase 4: API Development (Weeks 15-18)
Build APIs that power applications:
- **RESTful API Design:**
  - HTTP methods and status codes
  - Resource-oriented design
  - Versioning strategies
  - Pagination and filtering
- **GraphQL:**
  - Schema design and resolvers
  - Query optimization
  - Subscription management
- API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- API testing and validation

### Phase 5: Security & Authentication (Weeks 19-22)
Protect your systems and data:
- Authentication (sessions, JWT, OAuth)
- Authorization and access control
- Password hashing and storage
- HTTPS/SSL/TLS
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Security headers and best practices

### Phase 6: Advanced Topics (Weeks 23-28)
Master complex patterns:
- Microservices architecture
- Message queues and async processing
- Caching strategies (Redis, memcached)
- Database optimization
- Load balancing
- System design for scale
- Design patterns (Factory, Repository, Singleton)

## Key Skills

**Essential**
- At least one programming language mastery
- SQL databases and query optimization
- REST API design and development
- Git and version control
- Testing (unit and integration tests)

**Important**
- HTTP and web protocols
- Authentication and authorization
- Database indexing and optimization
- Error handling and logging
- Code organization and architecture

**Advanced**
- Microservices and distributed systems
- Message queues and event-driven architecture
- Performance optimization and caching
- System design for scalability
- DevOps and deployment fundamentals

## Prerequisites
