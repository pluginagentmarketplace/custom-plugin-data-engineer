# DevOps Engineer

Build and automate the infrastructure that powers applications. Master the tools and practices that enable rapid, reliable deployments and operational excellence.

## Overview

DevOps engineers bridge the gap between development and operations, automating infrastructure, deployments, and operational processes. This role combines systems administration, automation, and cloud expertise.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-6)
Build your technical foundation:
- Linux administration (Ubuntu, CentOS)
- Command-line proficiency (bash scripting)
- Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP)
- Git version control and workflows
- Python or Go programming basics
- Package management (apt, yum)

### Phase 2: Cloud Platforms (Weeks 7-12)
Choose and master one cloud provider:
- **AWS Recommended:**
  - EC2, S3, RDS, VPC
  - IAM and security
  - Auto-scaling and load balancing
  - CloudFormation basics
- **Alternative:** Azure or Google Cloud Platform
- Cloud architecture principles
- Cost optimization

### Phase 3: Containerization (Weeks 13-18)
Master container technologies:
- **Docker:**
  - Image creation and management
  - Container networking
  - Docker Compose
  - Image optimization and security
- **Kubernetes:**
  - Architecture (control plane, nodes)
  - Pods, deployments, services
  - ConfigMaps and secrets
  - Persistent volumes and storage
  - RBAC and security

### Phase 4: Infrastructure as Code (Weeks 19-22)
Automate infrastructure provisioning:
- **Terraform:**
  - HCL syntax and best practices
  - State management
  - Modules and reusability
  - Multi-cloud provisioning
- **Ansible:**
  - Configuration management
  - Playbook development
  - Automation best practices

### Phase 5: CI/CD & Automation (Weeks 23-26)
Build automated pipelines:
- **Choose One:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps
- Pipeline design patterns
- Automated testing integration
- Build and artifact management
- Deployment automation
- Release management

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Operations (Weeks 27-30)
Ensure system reliability:
- **Prometheus & Grafana:**
  - Metrics collection and visualization
  - Alerting and dashboards
- **Logging:** ELK Stack or Cloud-native solutions
- **Tracing:** Distributed tracing systems
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- SRE principles and incident management

## Key Skills

**Essential**
- Linux system administration
- Shell scripting (Bash)
- Docker and container concepts
- One cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP)

- AWS Certified Solutions Architect
- Azure Administrator (AZ-104)
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
- HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate

## Projects to Build

1. **Automated Infrastructure** - IaC for multi-tier application
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Complete build and deploy automation
3. **Kubernetes Deployment** - Containerized application
4. **Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
5. **Multi-Region Setup** - High-availability deployment

## Career Path

- **Entry Level:** $70K-$110K
- **Mid-Level:** $110K-$150K
- **Senior:** $150K-$200K
- **Staff/Lead:** $200K-$280K+

## Learning Methodology
