# Frontend Developer

Master the art of building beautiful, responsive, and performant user interfaces that engage millions of users.

## Overview

Frontend developers create the visual and interactive parts of web applications that users interact with directly. This role has evolved from simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript to a complex discipline involving modern frameworks, state management, testing, and deployment.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
Start with the fundamentals that power the web:
- How the internet and browsers work
- HTTP/HTTPS protocols and requests
- HTML5 fundamentals (semantic markup, forms, accessibility)
- CSS basics (box model, positioning, selectors)
- Git version control

### Phase 2: Core Technologies (Weeks 5-8)
Build your core skills with essential technologies:
- **CSS Mastery:** Flexbox, CSS Grid, responsive design, CSS variables
- **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Variables, functions, objects, DOM manipulation
- **Async JavaScript:** Promises, async/await, Fetch API
- **Package Managers:** npm, yarn, pnpm

### Phase 3: Modern Frameworks (Weeks 9-14)
Choose one framework and become proficient:
- **React:** Components, hooks, state management (Redux, Context API)

- **Angular:** TypeScript, dependency injection, RxJS
- Include: Routing, form handling, lifecycle management

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics (Weeks 15-20)
Deepen your expertise with advanced patterns:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Testing (Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, Cypress)
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Web security (CORS, XSS, CSRF, CSP)
- Accessibility (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### Phase 5: Production Skills (Weeks 21-26)
Prepare for production applications:
- Build tools and bundlers (Webpack, Vite)
